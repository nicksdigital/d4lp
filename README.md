HYDRA: A Hybrid Dynamic Reactive Automation Curve for Automated Market Makers
Abstract
This paper introduces HYDRA (HYbrid Dynamic Reactive Automation), a novel automated market maker (AMM) curve that combines sigmoid, gaussian, and rational functions to optimize liquidity distribution and market adaptability. We present theoretical foundations, implementation details, and empirical results demonstrating HYDRA's superior capital efficiency compared to existing solutions. Through extensive simulations and mathematical analysis, we show that HYDRA achieves up to 130% capital efficiency while maintaining price stability and reducing impermanent loss.
1. Introduction
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) have revolutionized decentralized exchanges by enabling permissionless liquidity provision. However, existing solutions face challenges in optimizing capital efficiency while maintaining price stability. Traditional constant product market makers (CPMMs) like Uniswap V2 provide robust price discovery but suffer from inefficient capital utilization. While concentrated liquidity solutions like Uniswap V3 improve capital efficiency, they introduce complexity and potential liquidity gaps.
HYDRA addresses these challenges through a novel hybrid approach that combines three complementary mathematical functions:

A sigmoid component for primary liquidity concentration
A gaussian component for smooth transitions
A rational component for tail behavior optimization

2. Mathematical Framework
2.1 Core Components
The HYDRA curve is defined by the following equation:
L(p,pt)=x⋅y⋅f(p,pt)L(p, p_t) = \sqrt{x \cdot y} \cdot f(p, p_t)L(p,pt​)=x⋅y​⋅f(p,pt​)
where $f(p, p_t)$ is the hybrid curve function:
f(p,pt)=ws⋅S(p,pt)+wg⋅G(p,pt)+wr⋅R(p,pt)f(p, p_t) = w_s \cdot S(p, p_t) + w_g \cdot G(p, p_t) + w_r \cdot R(p, p_t)f(p,pt​)=ws​⋅S(p,pt​)+wg​⋅G(p,pt​)+wr​⋅R(p,pt​)
With components:
Sigmoid Component:
S(p,pt)=11+e−k(1−∣ppt−1∣)S(p, p_t) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(1-|\frac{p}{p_t}-1|)}}S(p,pt​)=1+e−k(1−∣pt​p​−1∣)1​
Gaussian Component:
G(p,pt)=e−(p/pt−1)22σ2G(p, p_t) = e^{-\frac{(p/p_t-1)^2}{2\sigma^2}}G(p,pt​)=e−2σ2(p/pt​−1)2​
Rational Component:
R(p,pt)=11+∣ppt−1∣nR(p, p_t) = \frac{1}{1 + |\frac{p}{p_t}-1|^n}R(p,pt​)=1+∣pt​p​−1∣n1​
Where:

$p$ is the current price
$p_t$ is the target price
$k$ is the sigmoid steepness parameter
$\sigma$ is the gaussian width parameter
$n$ is the rational power parameter
$w_s, w_g, w_r$ are component weights

2.2 Dynamic Amplification
HYDRA implements dynamic amplification to optimize capital efficiency:
A(δ)=Abase⋅(1−min(δ,δmax))A(δ) = A_base \cdot (1 - min(δ, δ_{max}))A(δ)=Ab​ase⋅(1−min(δ,δmax​))
where:

$A_base$ is the base amplification factor (1.3)
$δ$ is the relative price deviation
$δ_{max}$ is the maximum amplification range (0.3)

3. Implementation
The HYDRA curve is implemented using fixed-point arithmetic with 18 decimal places precision. Key optimizations include:
solidityCopyfunction calculateLiquidity(
    uint256 x,
    uint256 y,
    uint256 currentPrice,
    uint256 targetPrice,
    HydraConfig memory config
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // Base liquidity calculation
    uint256 baseLiquidity = sqrt(x * y);
    
    // Price deviation
    uint256 priceRatio = currentPrice / targetPrice;
    uint256 priceDelta = abs(priceRatio - PRECISION);
    
    // Calculate components
    uint256 sigmoid = calculateSigmoid(priceDelta, config.sigmoidSteepness);
    uint256 gaussian = calculateGaussian(priceDelta, config.gaussianWidth);
    uint256 rational = calculateRational(priceDelta, config.rationalPower);
    
    // Combine with weights
    uint256 combined = (
        sigmoid * config.sigmoidWeight +
        gaussian * config.gaussianWeight +
        rational * config.rationalWeight
    ) / PRECISION;
    
    return (baseLiquidity * combined) / PRECISION;
}
